### Design Copper Networks
Design and analyze copper networks on existing landbase or by incorporating a developer's plan.  Capture count information in a GUI that checks logical counts and keeps a running tally of cable sheath counts and total cost as information is entered.  General BOM data, loop make-up reports.

### Design Fiber Networks
Design all requisite fiber architectures including FTTx.  Leverage tools to support wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing, as well as splicing and network tracing.  Perform circuit allocation and bandwidth management on an individual fiber basis.  Route and manage conduit within duct systems.

### Integrate with Construction Management Systems
Capture bills of materials during design for integration with procuremenet and construction management systems.  Validate data and deccisions during the design process to improve design quality and reduce revisions and rework during construction.

### Manage Communication Design Workflows'
Enable designers, contractors, and managers to fulfill and track work orders per your company practices. Create and assign work orders natively or through integration with your work management system. Get an instant view and notifications of pending, in-progress, past-due, and complete work orders.

### Prepare Work Prints
Create multi-page work prints according to telecommunications industry standards. Capture facility placement details, bills of material data, loop make-up reports, work steps, and contract work information during the design process. Generate permit drawings directly from engineering work prints. Validate against configurable business and engineering rules to minimize duplication of data and ensure accuracy.

### Review & Approve Communications Designs
Get automatic alerts of work orders awaiting review. Use links in the work order to quickly access and review design files. Approve designs or reject with remarks in the work order and markups on the design drawing. Optionally publish approved designs to your enterprise work management system.
